Okay, imagine you're on a Mac and you save a website link. Instead of a normal web address, it sometimes saves it as a special Mac file called a ".webloc" file.

This app is like a translator for those ".webloc" files. It takes that special Mac file and turns it into a regular ".url" file, which is the kind of web address file that works on Windows computers and other systems without any problems.

So, in simple terms, this app helps people who get website links saved as ".webloc" files (usually from Macs) open those links easily on other types of computers by converting them into a more standard format.

It has two main ways to do this:

Convert one file at a time: You pick a single ".webloc" file, and the app converts it to a ".url" file. You can even tell it to delete the original ".webloc" file after it's done.
Convert a whole folder: You select a folder full of ".webloc" files, and the app will go through each one and convert them all into ".url" files in either the same folder or a folder you choose. It can also delete the original ".webloc" files in bulk if you want.
Think of it as making sure everyone can open the website links, no matter what kind of computer they are using!
